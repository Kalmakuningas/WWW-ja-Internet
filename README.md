# hello-world
This project is for learning purposes.

I use most of my time listening music and even when im doing other stuff, i almost always listen music while doing them.
I Don't make music myself, but i would like to one day and learn to play two different instruments drums and synthesizer/keyboards.
It doesn't matter what type of music is, its fine when it sounds good, but i mostly listen metal music.
